# AdvancedList-SwiftUI

This repository contains a prototype implementation of an advanced list view for **SwiftUI**.

## Motivation

I often deal with lists which can have different view states (empty, error, items or loading). Currently I use an extended version of **IGListKit** to create these advanced lists.
